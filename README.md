**Introduction**

Godog is a basic framework with golang, which can help developers develop server quickly. It provides rich modules to help you.

It contains `config module`,`error module`,`logging module`,`net module` and `service module`. You can use any of the modules according to your needs. More modules will be added later. I hope you can join in and we make it more richer and useful that it can be used by more projects.
